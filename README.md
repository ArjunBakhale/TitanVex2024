# VEX Robot C++ Control System

This repository contains C++ code for our VEX robot's autonomous and controller operations.

## What We Did

We developed a comprehensive control system for our VEX robot using C++. Our code includes:

1. **Autonomous Mode**: 
   - Implemented path-following algorithms using the vex intertial sensor
   - Created routines for different starting positions and alliance colors
   - Developed a point-based autonomous selector on the brain's screen

2. **Driver Control**:
   - Programmed responsive tank drive with custom acceleration curves
   - Implemented precise arm control using PID
   - Created a toggle system for the claw mechanism

3. **Sensor Integration**:
   - Utilized encoder feedback for accurate movement
   - Implemented gyro-based turning for precise rotations
   - Integrated distance sensors for object detection

4. **Code Structure**:
   - Organized code into modular components for easy maintenance
   - Created a custom library for frequently used functions
   - Implemented a configuration file for easy parameter adjustments

5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Developed an autonomous recording system for easy path creation
   - Implemented odometry for advanced positioning

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in VEXcode Pro V5
3. Compile and download to your VEX V5 brain
